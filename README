# Node.js and Typescript Countdown Timer

This is a simple Node.js timer application that allows you to set a timer for a specific number of seconds, up to a maximum of 6 hours. It uses the `date-fns` library for date calculations and `inquirer` for user input.

## Features

- Set a timer for a specified number of seconds.
- Provides a visual countdown in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
- Timer expires when the countdown reaches zero, and a message is displayed.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd typescript-nodejs-countdown-timer
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the timer, run the following command:

```bash
npm index.js
```

You will be prompted to enter the number of seconds for the timer. The timer will start counting down, and the remaining time will be displayed in the console. Once the timer expires, a message will be shown, and the application will exit.

## Configuration

You can adjust the maximum timer duration by changing the `input > 21600` condition in the `validate` function of the `inquirer` prompt. By default, the maximum timer duration is set to 6 hours (21,600 seconds).
